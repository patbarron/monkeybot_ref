WPLUG.ORG monkeybot
===================

This is a set of reference sources for monkeybot, an IRC bot used by
WPLUG.ORG on the Freenode #wplug channel.

monkeybot is derived from infobot-0.45.3, with a number of local
modifications.

This is reference source code only - it has been santized to remove
credentials, log files, and databases.  It is not intended to
do any development against these sources, and no pull requests will
be accepted.  The primary purpose of making this source available
is for reference by those wishing to help refactor monkeybot using
a more modern bot architecture (such as Hubot).
